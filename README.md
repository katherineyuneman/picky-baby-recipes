# Picky Baby Food & Recipe App

## Description

Picky Baby app provides a food database that includes details about foods babies can eat when they start eating solid foods and at what specific age can start eating these foods.

Users who create an account using an email and password can also view recipes that include these foods as ingredients and create new recipes when they login with a username and password.

New foods can be created by adding a new recipe and adding new foods if they're not provided in the ingredient options.
